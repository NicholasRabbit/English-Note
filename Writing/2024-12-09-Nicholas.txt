At 7.30 p.m. last friday, I went to my office to have my online English class as usual but interrupted by my colleagues who were still working. Unfortunately, I had to cancel it because they were so irritating that I could not concentrate on learning. 

It is common that employees are forced to work overtime by their employers in an implicit way. Some obey, but others protest. The item-996-was coined to express anger over the harsh working environment. 996 means working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. Jack Ma, who is the founder of Alibaba, was widely condemned when he paied tribute to 996. Mr. Ma has become infamous and lost considerable numbers of adoring fans since then. 

In conclusion, work-life-balance is what we should persue. It is acknowledged that we should work for life, not live for work.
