Movies about wars, especially World War II, always intrigued me when I was younger. As growing old, I tend to watch documentary or real stories on TV. As far as I was concerned, what happens in the real world are much more exhilarating or more impresessive than what in movies which are adaptations of novels and not so attractive any more. 

Recently, I have watched a video about what happened in a battlefiled in frontline of Ukraine from BBC. A number of Unrainian troops were projectiling when facing Russian soliders. It is not like what we see in a film in which continuous sound of bombs, firing arms and piercing cry of wounded soliders spinge on audiencesâ€™ ears. On the contrary, there was an errie silence when all of them, a group of troops and the correspondents, speak in slow tongue. Soon they engaged with enemies and presumably many died on both sides. It is the real war which nobody except Putin wants to involve in. Life is short, but it is shorter when there is a war. All the peace lovers support Ukraine to defend itself and not to concede their occupied territory when  they sign a treaty with Russians. 

On the other hand, it was a warning for those rich European countries. The war resulted that Sweden and Finland joined the NATO, which is perhaps a bad news for Mr. Putin. I am not interested in international politics as many haters on the Internet. What I really care about is to live without being threatened to death by another world war.
