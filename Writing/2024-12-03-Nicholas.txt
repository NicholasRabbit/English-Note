It is the last month of 2024 and winter has already come. The lowest tempreture is below zero at midnight. After waiting for about nine months, 
I finally started my fist online English course today. How I wish I could have done it earlier! 
I went to my office where the speed of the Internet is high so I can talk to my tutor without latency. Although it is too late,
it is better than nothing. There is a good news which is that my tutor told me I am still young. That is encouraging for a thirty-year-old man who is going bald. If my memory serves, my heart was broken at the first time when a child called me uncle on a train to college. However, I was less than twenty years old then. But I should have realised that I have already grown up. My classmates also had the same experience, especially my female classmates who were deeply frustrated when they were addressed aunt instead of sister. How time flies. We are used to be called uncle and grandparents in the near future.
