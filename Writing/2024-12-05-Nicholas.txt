In a scorching hot Sunday morning this summer, I drove my wife to consult a prominent practioner in a town near my home. Patients were waiting in the small clinic, sometimes chatting in a slow measured tongue while their families stayed outside. It would be take us at least half an hour to talk to the doctor. So I walk around to buy some drinks for her.

The traffic volume had increased with more and more customers coming and going at intervals. To my surprise, on the opposite side of the road stood a small chruch where people were singing religious songs. Many believe that most Chinese are atheists. Whereas, there are small groups of Christians distributed in innumerable small villages in rural China, as can be seen in some churches like this one. 

In addition, there is an immense Cathedral in the east of the county where I live, but there is not too many activities except for some gatherings where children can get candies in Christmas Eve.  I had visited it a couple of times when I was a student. It is refurbished sometimes as an attraction to toursits by the municipality. 

The Christians I know always leave a good impression on me since they are friendly and warmhearted, which is precious in such a drastically changed country.
