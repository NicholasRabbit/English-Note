When I was a child my dream was to become a scientist which was quite popular prefession among children at that time. Irronically, if asked what kind of scientist we want to be, most of us could not give any details. Pupils are always naive so that they are significantly impacted by political propagandas.

However, this dream wasn’t fulfiled when I grown up because I had realised that a scientist was a demanded occupation but was not a lucrative one. Moreover, there are not enough vacancies in a country. Labourers, drivers, doctors, programmers and so forth are also alternative choices. 

When it comes to dream, many feel frustrated for not achieving their goals even though some of them are unrealistic. However, I am not deeply disappointed that I don’t become a scientist. One reason is that presumably I am not talented in any particular scientific area. The other is the dream was made by the notorious mind-control educational systems and we accepted the dream unconsciously. What most horrific is a small proportion of students took it seriously and wasted all the time on it. 

Fortunately, as a mid-aged man, I have a more practical goal which is to earn much money to travel around the world with my family in the near future.
