Today I read an introduction about famous castles in Europe. To my surprise, the oldest one was built on a mountain in 1066. It dominated the landscape and was surrounded by snow-covered mountains. The castle which I can only see in Disney movies is in the real world. I have watched many movies about what the life is in castles. A lord were talking with his families around a long table where you can see the most sumptuous dinner. There were countless annecdotes and scandals about these nobels. 
As history moves on, these castles are all open to public so we, as oridinary people, can visit these attractions. To visit these acient building is unique and unforgetable experience. 
A few years ago, I have visited an old town when I worked in Tianjin. There were many villas dating back to 1800s. When I was walking on the cobbled street in the conservative area, I couldn’t help imagining what the owners did in their home. Did they do the same kind of job as we do nowadays? Though many historians conducted researches on one particular period of history and had written many books. Whereas, visiting this acients houses is utterly different from reading books. There isn’t too many words on the wall except for the door numbers or the oweners’ names. But it is every single brick that tells me about the life and death which are nothing but as same as today. 
Finally, I have added these spectacular attractions to my touring list. Perhaps I can visit one of them in the near future.
