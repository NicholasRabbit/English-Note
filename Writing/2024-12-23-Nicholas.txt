In China, there are two alternative choices for patients. One is the modern western medical system and the other is the Chinese traditional therapy. Some of the elderly people prefer to the latter rather than the former when they develop chronic disease. But the numbers of them is decreasing because of the time-consumed treatment and the unsatisfied result. Therefore, the scientific modern hospitals are the first choice for most of us even though the price is extremely high and the healthy care insurance can only cover small part of the bill. 

Seldom has a patient been cured by having Chinese herbs. It is not about the natural resources. It is the general paratitioners who are the key factor in the treatment. There are many mediocre physicians around this country and exceptional doctors who have the expertise on acient therapy are almost extinct. There was a patient who were terminally ill after developing cancer and managed to prolong his life with the help of herbs priscribed by a unknown therapist who might hide in a small clinic of a remote village. That will happen again no matter whether it is true or not. 

When I was a child, I was prone to illness. My mother brought to the clinic in my village and the doctor prescribed me six or nine packets of tablets. Take one after each meal, said she seriously. If my body tempreture was over thirty-nine degrees Celsius when I had a fever or caught a cold, I had to get an injection. That’s a painful memory and that’s why I keep running to be stronger since I was a pupil. There is an incessant battle between disease and my immune system.  Apparently, it will continue until the last day of my life.
