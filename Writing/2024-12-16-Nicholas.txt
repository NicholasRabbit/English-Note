After constantly working for eight hours in front of computer, I felt absolutely exhausted and did not want to watch screen any more, not mention to watching a bright mobile screen close to my face. It was like that my head became bigger after strenuous mental labour. Whereas, reading books, the paper books, alleviates my headache after a day of grinding work. It is like a kind of entertainment. I don’t have to finish it before deadline so I can read those words in a slow measured pace. 

At the age of social media, considerable amount of informationf from platforms such as Twitter, Tiktok and so forth comes out and causes disorder in many user’s brains. Apparently, human beings have not developed the ability yet to adopt those countless news, memes and videos. Eventually, we always feel suffocated in the ocean of the Internet. 

On the contrary, reading is cathartic and therapeutic. We have been reading for thousands of years before the invention of computer. It is an innate ability and we should use it rather than waste time on junk news on the Internet. Almost all the intellectuals, scientists, and others professionals wirte books in which authors put great thoughts and achievements of their whole life so we don’t need to spend time on searching for the solution of thoses same answers so that we can explore further by standing on their shoulders. Perhaps that is the developing pattern of an individual and the human’s history. 

In conclusion, there are also countless books online and they are worth our time while, not the exhilarating but radiculous short videos.
