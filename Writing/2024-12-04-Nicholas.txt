As an incompetent cook am I, I prefer to make three meals everyday rather than eat at roadside diners. Today, I had self-made lunch as usual. Though it was as delicious as in restaurant, I like it. One reason is that cooking at home doesnâ€™t cost too much. The second is that the food from bistros is gradually becoming terrible when you have been eating for a long time. Perhaps the main reason is that I can parctise cooking skills.
