A presenter of a talk show named “Wentao’s Friends” said he felt lonely in Beijing but did not in HongKong when he was talking about the life in metropolitians. As I had worked in the capital for couple of months, I completely agree with him even though I have never been to HongKong. Both of them are densely populated mega cities, why do we have different feelings?

One reason is that there is not any friends or realtives for a visitor or outsider. Though a person have been working in tier-one cities like Beijing for many years, he or she only has colleagues or acquaintances. As social animals, human beings tend to be in the mood of melancholy when they are isolated. Presumably, joining countless parties alleviate the pain to some extent, but when they wake next morning lonliness raise again. 

The second reason, which is perhaps the most critical one, is that the constantly existed hierachical social system in China. “Domestic passport” is very typtical product of it. It is reasonable that a foreigner need passport when travelling to another country. Ohterwise, we can not apply visa or buy a ticket. What is a “domestic passport”? In a word, foreigners from the same country could have the equal right as the locals no matter how long they have worked there. For instance, in a city the chidren of a resident who has not the domestic passport are not allow to go to any school.  As a matter of fact, that is the real reason beneath the properity of the country.
